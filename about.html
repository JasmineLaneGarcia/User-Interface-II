            <h3>A Career Collector</h3>
            <h4>A big thanks to Winnie Song for the title idea!</h4>
            <p>Some of us struggle with answering the question, "What do I want to do for the rest of my life?"</p>
            <p>I have never given a straight answer. In fact, I changed the question.</p>
            <p><span>"What do I want to do right now?"</span></p>
            <p>I've filled numerous hats in various fields since I've been old enough to shave.</p>
            <p>You may have seen me at the local cellular shop, waving from afar in a giant cell-phone costume.</p>
            <p>Or perhaps marching with my fellow sweaty comrades at bootcamp for the army.</p>
            <p>Maybe you got a flat tire and pulled into the wheel repair shop to be greeted by a grungey version of me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But my fallback has always been a tech-y artist.</p>
            <p>I say techy artist because I simply love tech as much as I love art!</p>
            <p>I have a 7 year background in graphic design and I'm now working to push a little further into tech & design <br> with web development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My other big fascination is centered around dragons, which I now have a pet beardie of my own!</p>
            <p>Named Runaga, she's a year old chubby sweetheart.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you ever look me up, just know I've kept all my references;)</p>
